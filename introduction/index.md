# Dynamsoft Camera Enhancer - Introductions

## Overview of Dynamsoft Camera Enhancer

Dynamsoft Camera Enhancer (DCE) is an SDK specifically designed for improving video frame decoding. Before video frames is transfered to decode process, DCE will do a series of pre-treatment including camera control and frame filter. This process can largely reduce the rate of misreading. You can start your decode program development with DCE and also you can import DEC algorithm in your developed app to improve its performance. 

## Main features

- Auto focus
- Sensor control
- frame filter
- Auto zoom

## Principle
Sensor control, auto focus and frame filter are the core principle of Dynamsoft Camera Enhancer. Sensor control and auto focus are aimed at creating higher quality frames by controlling camera. These two process are making sure the camera can capture frames as clear as possible. 
The following action, Frame filter, give all frames captured by camera a quick scan to detect its clarity degree.
